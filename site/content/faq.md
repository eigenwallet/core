<summary>Why is the protocol secure?</summary>
The protocol is secure because it uses atomic swaps.
Atomic swaps are secured by the underlying blockchains (Bitcoin and Monero) and guarantee that you can't lose your funds.
Either the swap succeeds or you can refund.

<summary>Why only in one direction?</summary>
Because of Monero's lack of support for scripting. 
With the next hardfork ("FCMP++") -- which is expected to be released in 2026 -- Monero will support transaction chaining.
This will allow for atomic swaps in both directions.
