## What is an Atomic Swap?

Atomic swaps are cross-blockchain transactions that are executed without the need for a centralized exchange.
They are _atomic_ because the protocol guarantees that you will not lose your assets if the swap fails^[1].

## How does eigenwallet work?

**eigenwallet** is a protocol _and_ app.
When you run the app, you can connect to and swap with different _makers_.
_Makers_ are users who run the eigenwallet protocol on their own computer or server to provide liquidity.
They buy your Bitcoin and in return give you Monero.
Each maker sets their own prices and fees.
