# Installation

To install the app you can either download ready-to-use binaries or build it from source.
Unless you know what you're doing, you probably want to use the precompiled binaries.

## Precompiled binaries

Precompiled binaries of the _GUI_ are available for most platforms. Simply download the appropriate binary for your system and follow the instructions.

    For other Linux distributions, you can download the AppImage and run it directly. It includes all dependencies and will work on most systems.

    ```bash filename="install.sh"
    wget https://github.com/eigenwallet/core/releases/download/1.0.0-rc.4/UnstoppableSwap_1.0.0-rc.4_amd64.AppImage
    chmod +x UnstoppableSwap_1.0.0-rc.4_amd64.AppImage
    ./UnstoppableSwap_1.0.0-rc.4_amd64.AppImage
    ```

    Due to limitations with our CI pipeline, we currently can't provide precompiled binaries for arm64 linux systems.

    For Linux systems with Flatpak support, you can install UnstoppableSwap directly from our Flatpak repository:

    ```bash filename="install.sh"
    # Add the eigenwallet repository
    flatpak remote-add --user unstoppableswap https://unstoppableswap.github.io/core/unstoppableswap.flatpakrepo

    # Install the application
    flatpak install unstoppableswap net.unstoppableswap.gui

    # Run the application
    flatpak run net.unstoppableswap.gui
    ```

    **Requirements:**
    - Flatpak 1.0 or newer
    - x86_64 architecture

    **Updates:**
    ```bash
    flatpak update net.unstoppableswap.gui
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

## Building from source

If you want to build the application from source you'll need to have the following tools installed:

- `cargo` ([installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)) and `cargo tauri` ([installation](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/cli/) and [prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/))
- `node` ([installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)) and `yarn` (version 1.22, not 4.x)
- `dprint` (`cargo install dprint@0.50.0`)
- `typeshare` (`cargo install typeshare-cli`)

After that you only need to clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eigenwallet/core.git
cd core/src-tauri
cargo tauri build # may take a while
```

This will create the `core/target/release/bundle` folder which contains the executable in a platform specific folder.
By default this will compile the binary the platform you are currently on.
You can configure this using options for the `cargo tauri build` command ([docs](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/cli/#build)).
