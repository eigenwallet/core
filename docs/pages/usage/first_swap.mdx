# How to complete your first swap

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of completing your first atomic swap using the eigenwallet GUI.
Although the process is quite intuitive, there are some nuances to be aware of, so we'll cover everything you need to know to get started.

## Prerequisites

To complete an Atomic Swap, you'll need to have the following:

1. A Monero wallet you can use to receive funds
2. _UnstoppableSwap GUI_ installed on your computer. 
We'll refer to this as _GUI_ from now on. View the [installation instructions](../getting_started/install_instructions) if you haven't already installed the GUI.
3. A Bitcoin wallet you can use with some funds in it which you want to convert to Monero.

## Performing the swap
<Steps>
### Choose a _maker_ to swap with

In the bottom of the screen you can see the currently selected _maker_. 
This is who you'll send your Bitcoin to and who you'll receive the Monero from. 
You can change the _maker_ by clicking on the arrow and selecting a different _maker_ from the list.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">
Different _makers_ offer different exchange rates and differing amounts of liquidity. You may want to choose the _maker_ that best suits your needs.
</Callout>

You can use the input field to calculate the approximate amount of Monero you'll receive for a given amount of Bitcoin.

<Callout type="info">
The actual swap amount will be determined when you deposit your Bitcoin. 
This is only used as a reference for you to get a rough idea of how much Monero you'll receive for your Bitcoin.
</Callout>

### Start the Swap

Once you've selected a _maker_, you can start the swap by clicking the `Swap` button. 
This will open a new window where you need to enter two addresses:

1. the Monero address you want to receive the Monero to
2. the Bitcoin address where you want to receive the Bitcoin refund incase the swap is not completed successfully.

### Depositing Bitcoin

After pressing the <img src="/start_swap_button.png" style={{
    height: "1lh",
    display: "inline-block",
    // center vertically
    verticalAlign: "middle",
}}/> button, you'll be shown an offer by the _maker_. This includes:

- the exchange rate (how much Bitcoin they demand for 1 Monero)
- the minimum and maximum amounts you can swap
- the network fees that'll be spent on the Bitcoin lock transaction

<Callout type="info">
You can hover over these values to see their value in `USD`.
</Callout>

If you're happy with the offer, you can proceed by sending the Bitcoin to the address displayed on the screen.
All funds sent to this address will be used for the swap as long as they below the maximum amount.

<Callout type="info">
This is where the actual swap amount is determined.
Be careful to send only as much Bitcoin as you want to swap.
</Callout>

### Waiting for the swap to complete

After sending the Bitcoin, you'll need to wait a moment for the Bitcoin to be locked.
After the lock transaction has been confirmed, the other party will lock the Monero funds.
In most cases, it will take around 10 minutes for the Bitcoin lock transaction to be confirmed and 2 minutes later the Monero lock transaction will be confirmed.

The swap will go through four stages:

1. **Locking the Bitcoin**:
Your Bitcoin is locked in a 2-of-2 multisig address.

2. **_Maker_ locks the Monero**:
The other party locks their Monero as well.

3. **_Maker_ redeems _Bitcoin_**:
The other party redeems the Bitcoin.

4. **Redeeming the Monero**:
You redeem the Monero using a key that was revealed in step 3.
