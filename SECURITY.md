# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you found a security vulnerability, please do not share it publicly. 
Follow the responsible disclosure procedure by submitting a private message. 
You can do so on GitHub (see the "Security") tab or on matrix (message @einliterflasche2:matrix.org or @binarybaron:matrix.org).

To help us understand the nature and scope of the potential issue, please provide as much information as possible, including a description of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and steps for reproducing it or proof of concept.

We ask that you do not disclose the issue to others until we've had a chance to address it.

Please encrypt any reports using one of our GPG keys ([link](https://github.com/eigenwallet/core/tree/master/utils/gpg_keys)).

### Our Commitment

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, we commit to:

 - Acknowledging receipt of your report in a timely manner.
 - Providing an estimated timeline for addressing the vulnerability.
 - Keeping you informed about the progress of addressing the vulnerability.
 - Publicly acknowledging your contribution, if you wish, once the vulnerability has been resolved.
